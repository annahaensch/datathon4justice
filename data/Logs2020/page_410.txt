Unable to make contact with residents at reported address at  this time.  Narrative:  Followed up on previous call. Spoke with the owner of the  dog who stated he raised his fist towards the dow and did  pull the dog into the house by the fur on the back of its  neck. I looked at the dog and it didn't have any visible  signs of abuse. The owner was advised of the cruelty to  animal laws.  20-2652  Lit  Initiated - PARKING CHECK  SERVICES RENDERED  Cail Taker:  PATROL BRAD SACCO  Location/Address:  PARK ST  Unit:  34  Arvd-11:12:17  Clyd-11:13:29  Narrative:  2 Violation  20-2653  1114  Initiated - PARKING CHECK  SERVICES RENDERED  Call Taker:  PATROL BRAD SACCO  Location/Address:  SPRING ST  Unit:  34  Arvd-11:14;11  Clrd@-11:17:14  20-2654  1131  Phone - ASSIST OTHER AGENCY  ~ FIRE  SERVICES RENDERED  Cail Taker:  PATROL DAVID JENNINGS, D  Location/Address:  {WIA 333] CHURCH ST  Narrative:  Testing sprinkler system.  20-2655  1144  Initiated - MOTOR VEHICLE STOP  CRIMINAL COMPLAINT  Call Taker  PATROL BRAD SACCO  Location/Address  COLD SPRING RD  Unit  34  Arvd-11:44:19  Clird-12:16:32  Vehicle  BLU 2011 TOYT VENZA Reg: PC MA 753RLi VIN: 4T3BA3BBXBU027016  BORAWSKI, TERRY W JR @ 1 CONRAD ST ~ ADAMS,  MA 01220  Operator  Race:  W Sex: M  Refer To Citation  72294170  Owner  BENNETT, TIFFANY L @ 3 MYRTLE ST Apt. #C10 - ADAMS, MA 01220-1792  Race: U Sex: F  Refer To Summons:  20-19-AR  Summons:  BORAWSKI, TERRY W JR  Address:  1 CONRAD ST  ADAMS, MA  Age:  40  Charges:  UNREGISTERED MOTOR VEHICLE  UNLICENSED OPERATION OF MV  20-2656  1456  Walk-In - BURN PERMIT  LOG ENTRY REQUEST  Call Taker:  DISPATCHER LAURIE TUPER  Narrative:  Dropped off the following addresses for today's burning  permits.  807 North Hoosac Rd  34 Henderson Rd  1059 North Hoosac Rd  245 Bulkiey St.  20-2657  1522  Initiated - PARKING CHECK  SERVICES RENDERED
