Narrative:  CP reports 4 kids going into the mill, CP states one is  Carter the other is Caleb and doesn't know the name of the  other 2.  Narrative:  Ofc. Jennings contacted Beth Westcott while I was enroute.  Westcott stated she could see her son and three friends  playing football on Mill Street. I met with Westcott and the  four juveniles who admitted they were by the mill and were  curious to see what it looked like inside; however, they  were unable to enter the property. All youths advised of the  dangers the property presents and to refrain from trying to  enter again. All children were extremely cooperative and  agreed to not enter again.  20-3292  1343  Initiated -  ASSIST OTHER AGENCY  - DPW  TAKEN/REFERRED TO OTHER  AGENCY  Call Taker  SERGEANT SCOTT E MCGOWAN  MILL ST  Location/Address  Unit  31  Arvd-13:43:00 Clrd-13:44:37  Narrative  Small sink hole next to catch basin.
