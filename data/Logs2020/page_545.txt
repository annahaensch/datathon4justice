They advised that the trail  is accessed across from 118 Bee Hill Rd. In approximately  600 meters. You have to cross 2 streams and it is at the top  of the first set of hills on the right in a low hanging  branch. She thinks it may be a deer bone, but is unsure.  Thinks it suspicious that it is in a bag in the tree.
