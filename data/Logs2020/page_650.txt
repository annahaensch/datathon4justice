Narrative  I spoke with employee, Rich, who states he activated the  alarm upon entering the store. Rich believed he eneterd the  proper code that would prevent the alarm company from  reporting the activation. Rich also stated he heard the  telephone ring, but did not answer as he was in the process  of opening for the day. Rich advised to call the WPD or  alarm company in the future to cancel our response as the  alarm company will report the incident when their call goes  unanswered.  20-4227 |  1104  Phone - B.0.L.0.
