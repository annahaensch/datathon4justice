Narrative  Attempted call back. No voicemail set up.  Sacco spoke with Dave Wiles who stated that the flowers were  an un-maintained flower bed that the Housing Authority  allows, but if unkempt, they remove same. Wiles stated that  it was 5-6 weeks after she moved to her new apartment that  his crew began dismantling the flower bed as technically, it  was not. supposed to be there. Several residents approached  him asking if they could have the plants as he was  discarding same. Wiles agreed and allowed them to take the  piants. Wiles stated that 1-2 weeks after the removal of the  plants, she became angry about the situation. Not a police  matter, this should be taken up with the Housing Authority.  .
