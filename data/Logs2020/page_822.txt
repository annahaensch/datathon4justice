Narrative:  On June 6, 2020, Turning Point employee Kim Kennedy, called  to report after the police response, Mr. Nawazelski, sprayed  Mr. Allard, with a hose and put soap on him, which  ultimately entered Mr. Allard's eyes. Ms. Kennedy states Mr.  Nawazelski has a history of abuse and regularly harasses Mr.  Allard, and she would like court action. I advised Ms.  Kennedy why the WPD would not seek a criminal complaint and  provided her with suggestions on how to handle the matter  internally. I also advised Ms. Kennedy I would document her  report, and she was pleased with the police assistance  today.  (The call with Ms. Kennedy was placed from a  department recorded line at 10:17 am.)
