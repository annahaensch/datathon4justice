Narrative:  I spoke with Lafleur via telephone, who reported Turning  Point employee, Angela Guzzi, is refusing to give him his  pain medication, because he will not turn over his car keys  to her. Lafleur states that Guzzi is upset because he  admitted to her that he drove his vehicle from his home to  the mailboxes in Pines Lodge. Lafleur was advised of his  options and decided, at this time,  to not pursue the matter  until he can speak with a Brien Center supervisor tomorrow.  While speaking with Lefleur, he was calm and cooperative and  indicated he has no suicidal ideations.  Lefleur was also  advised not to drive a motor vehicle.  20-5961,  1610  Phone - TRAFFIC COMPLAINT  GONE ON ARRIVAL  Cail Taker  DISPATCHER LAURIE TUPER  Location/Address  SIMONDS .RD  Unit  35  Disp-16:12:21 Enrt-16:13:04  Cird-16:21:06  Unit  38  Disp-16:15:23  Arvd-16:16:02 Clrd-16:21:10  Vehicle  RED 2012 JETTA Reg: PC RI DZ681 VIN: 3VW2K7AJ9CM467970  Operator  LYNCH, THOMAS @ 19 IVY HOLLOW CT ~- CRANSTON, RI 02921  Race: U Sex: U  Owner  LYNCH, THOMAS @ 19 IVY HOLLOW CT - CRANSTON, RI 02921  Race: U Sex: U  Narrative  Erratic operation (Speeding and swerving)of a red Voikswagon  Jetta with RI PC Dz681.  20-5962  1629  911 - 9-1-1 TEST CALL  SERVICES RENDERED  Cail Taker:  DISPATCHER LAURIE TUPER  Location/Address:  {WIA 390] SIMONDS RD  Narrative:  All procedures followed.  20-5963  1659  Initiated - BUILDING CHECK  BUILDING CHECKED/SECURED  Call Taker  PATROL BRAD SACCO  Location/Address  (WIA 910] TACONIC TRL  Unit  35  Arvd-16:59:09 Clrd~16:59:12  Narrative  Checked Area.  20-5964  1704  Initiated - BUILDING CHECK  BUILDING CHECKED/SECURED  Call Taker  PATROL BRAD SACCO  Location/Address  {WIA 100] SOUTH ST  Unit  35  Arvd-17:04:12 Clrd-17:08:53  Narrative  Checked Area.  20-5966  2010  Phone ~ VANDALISM  INVESTIGATED / REPORT  TAKEN  Call Taker  DISPATCHER LAURIE TUPER  Location/Address  NORTH HOOSAC RD  Unit  38  Disp-20:11:37 Enrt-20:12:00 Arvd-20:15:29  Clrd-20:32:53  Vehicle  BLK 2018 TOYT RAV4 Reg: PC MA 775DZ7 VIN: 2T3RFREV3JW793788  ce
